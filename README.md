Open your terminal/console and run the commands below.

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
# Attention! If you forked the repository, you should change the clone URL accordingly

cd secure-git-workshop || exit
```

### 2. Move to the 'start' branch

If it's a university project, use your student email.    
It's a work project, use your company email.    
```bash

git config user.email "your@mail.com"
```
