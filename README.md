## (in)secure git workshop 🔓+🔑 = 🔐
The present repository has several branches, each with a distinct challenge.    
You can observe the several steps in the workshop diagram [[+]](workshop_steps.png).

### Starting points 🚗 
1. The present repo is for demonstration purposes     
2. There are bad practices everywhere ⚡☠️
3. We'll fix them throughout the workshop!

### Execution options 💻
- Linux or macOS terminal (you can use the subject's virtual machine, it already has all the necessary tools installed)
- Or Fork repo and use GitHub Actions
    - When forking, don't forget to uncheck the option `Copy the main branch only`. You need to fork all existing branches.
    - You will need to activate the issues (Settings -> General -> Issues)
